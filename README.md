# Econ-148-Project-3

This is the repository for the third project in the course ECON 148 Data Science for Economists Spring 2024 at the University of California, Berkeley.

This assignment was to reproduce the analysis of a paper by Edward Miguel by translating the original paper's code from Stata to Python and interpret any disprecancy from the original analysis (if there's any). The paper is "Non-economic factors in violence: Evidence from organized crime, suicides and climate in Mexico" by Ceren Baysen, Marshall Burke, Felipe González, Solomon Hsiang, Edward Miguel. The original paper can be found [here](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24897/w24897.pdf).

The data used in the project can be found on the Harvard Dataverse [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HFH5BN). We are using the 1.0 version of the data published on September 08, 2020. The necessary datasets are also included in the data folder of this repository.

The Python code is written and run through a Python 3.11.8 distribution and requires the following packages (version number I have used in parenthesis)

- ```pandas (2.1.4)```
- ```numpy (1.26.4)```
- ```scipy (1.11.4)```
- ```statsmodels (0.14.0)```
- ```matplotlib (3.8.3)```
- ```stargazer (0.0.7)```

Be aware that if running a pandas version older than 2.1.0, the `.map` method might not work as intended and will need to be replaced with the now deprecated `.applymap`. This is the only known issue when running the code on older versions.

Other than the README.md, the repository contains the following folders and files:
- [econ148_proj3_main.ipynb](econ148_proj3_main.ipynb): The main notebook containing the code for the project
- [Econ 148 Report.pdf](Econ%20148%20Report.pdf): The final report for the project
- [tables](tables): Contains the output tables as `.tex` generated by the code; a total of 8 tables are generated
- [figures](figures): Contains the output figures generated by the code; only 4 figures are generated
- [data](data): Contains all the datasets provided through the Harvard Dataverse.
- [Non-economic factors in violence: Evidence from organized crime, suicides and climate in Mexico.pdf](Non-economic%20factors%20in%20violence%20Evidence%20from%20organized%20crime%2C%20suicides%20and%20climate%20in%20Mexico.pdf): The original paper by Ceren Baysen, Marshall Burke, Felipe González, Solomon Hsiang, Edward Miguel
